# üìä Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

## üìå Description

This project benchmarks the execution time of different sorting algorithms under various conditions.  
The goal is to compare their performance with different **input sizes** and **initial orderings**.

### üß† Sorting Algorithms Tested

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Quick Sort

### üß™ Test Cases

Each algorithm will be tested with array sizes of:

- **1,000 elements**
- **5,000 elements**
- **10,000 elements**
- **30,000 elements**

And under three input conditions:

- **Random order**
- **Sorted (ascending)**
- **Reverse order (descending)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Use existing implementations of the sorting algorithms (from libraries or trusted sources).
2. Measure the **execution time** for each case using a high-resolution timer.
3. Fill in the results table below.
4. Create **graphs** to visualize the results (in Excel or Google Sheets).
5. Submit:
   - The code used to run the benchmarks
   - The spreadsheet with results and graphs
